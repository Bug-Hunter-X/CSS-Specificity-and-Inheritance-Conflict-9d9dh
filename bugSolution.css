The solution involves ensuring that the style directly affects the targeted element, not relying solely on inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red; /* Directly set the color property in p */
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This will now correctly override the color set on the p element */
}
```

Alternatively, if inheritance is intended and the color needs to be adjusted, use !important flag:

```css
div p {
  color: green !important; /* This will override any inherited color */
}
```

By directly setting the color in the `p` selector or employing the `!important` flag, the specificity issue is circumvented, and the desired style is correctly applied.
