The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is intended to override the color of paragraphs within divs */
}
```

In this example, the `div p` selector has higher specificity than the `p` selector, but it may unexpectedly not override the `color: red` inherited from the `p` selector if the `color` property is set to `inherit` or it's value is inherited from parent element  instead of directly declared in `p` selector. This happens because the specificity is resolved before the inheritance is considered.
